# Pacman
A simple Pacman game clone (with my own personal touches) in Object Oriented Python

Assets Credit:
Ghosts and powerup came from "Superjustinbros" on spriters-resource.com, however were edited and recolored by me.
Music came from "Kat" on opengameart.org. https://opengameart.org/content/title-theme-8-bit-style
